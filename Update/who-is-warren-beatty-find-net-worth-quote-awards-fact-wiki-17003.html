He is not only a popular actor, but also a screenwriter, film producer and director. Warren Beatty is a winner of Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and he has also set the record of being nominated twice for the best actor, writer, producer and director of the same film.</p><p>So just how rich is Warren Beatty? Warren has accumulated an estimated net worth of $60 million, which wealth he has earned from his aforementioned activities in the film industry.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=warren-beatty-net-worth-60-million></span>Warren Beatty Net Worth $60 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Warren Beatty was born into the family of educators Kathlyn Corinne MacLean and Ira Owens Beatty. He was encouraged to become interested in acting by his sister, so learnt the basics by becoming a stagehand during school and university vacations, and actually droped out of NorthWestern University to study acting with Stella Adler in New Your City. He opened his net worth account debuting in the television shows ‘Kraft Television Theatre’ and ‘Studio One’ directed by Paul Nickell, Franklin Schaffner in 1957, and also successfully worked on Broadway, winning a nomination of a Tony Award for the Best Actor as well as a Theatre World Award in 1960.</p><p>Warren Beatty’s debut on the big screen was worth a Golden Globe Award for the New Star of the Year for his role of Bud Stamper in Elia Kazan’s directed film ‘Splendor in the Grass’. Beatty added to his net worth starring in the films ‘The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone’ directed by José Quintero, ‘All Fall Down’ directed by John Frankenheimer, ‘Lilith’ written and directed by Robert Rossen, ‘Mickey One’ directed by Arthur Penn, ‘Promise Her Anything’ directed by Arthur Hiller, and ‘Kaleidoscope’ directed by Jack Smight. In addition to this, in 1967 Warren became a producer of a film as an actor, and this turned-out to be a very successful work, which brought ‘Bonnie and Clyde’, directed by Arthur Penn, a number of nominations, winning a Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for the Best Film, and a Laurel Award for the Top Action-Drama Film.</p><p>Following this success, Warren appeared as the star, as well as co-writing and producing ‘Shampoo’ directed by Hal Ashby. For this film, Warren received nominations for Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards for Best Writing and the Best Actor thus increasing his net worth and popularity considerably. Moreover, Warren Beatty felt he could do more than this and produced, directed, wrote and starred in ‘Heaven Can Wait’ and ‘Reds’, after which he collected all the nominations for Academy Awards, and won a huge number of other notable awards. He proved to be a genius in filmography, and so Warren Beatty’s net worth rose significantly at this point. Furthermore, the films ‘Dick Tracy’ in which he was an actor, director and producer, ‘Bugsy’ an actor and producer, ‘Love Affair’ an actor, writer and producer, ‘Bulworth’ an actor, producer, director, and writer also brought him a number of nominations and awards. Overall, Warren Beaty has been involved in one form or several in over 30 films, spanning almost 60 years.

When I direct myself, I do more takes than if I’m being directed by someone else. Rather than stop and look at it, I just do it again. And I like to have my fellow actors feel that they’re directing it at the same time. I try to lead them into thinking it’s sort of a fake democracy, when it’s actually, ultimately, kind of a fascist dictatorship, one would have to admit.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>A director needs to be in control, but he really shouldn’t be in complete control, because then things could be very boring, and he wouldn’t take advantage of unexpected developments and opportunities. There are people who storyboard everything. I don’t do that. I’ll storyboard some stuff, but mainly I’m ready for the unexpected. I think that’s important. You can’t plan too much. I always think of a quote from Napoleon when they asked him to explain the intricacies of his battle plan. He said, ‘Well here’s the plan. First we go there, and then we see what happens.’</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>[on doing stunts] You try to measure up the safety concerns with the adrenaline concerns, the narcissism concerns, and the ambition concerns, and hope you don’t make a mistake.

[2016].</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cher on Beatty: Warren has probably been with everybody I know.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Britt Ekland on Beatty: He knew exactly where to locate the top button. One flick and we were on our way.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Notable women who rejected his advances include Carmen Phillips, Kim Novak and Sean Young. Fran Drescher claims to have turned down an offer to join Beatty and Isabelle Adjani for a ménage à trois (mentioned in her autobiography).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Unequivocally the most selective and least prolific star in cinema history. Beatty has only made 23 movies to date in a film career spanning 55 years. One popular theory as to why he turned down so many roles, at least until his marriage in 1992, is that he didn’t like interrupting his prolific intimate life by going to work.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Claimed that director Luchino Visconti begged him to star in The Leopard (1963) but he wasn’t interested so Alain Delon was cast instead.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Turned down title role in the political comedy Dave (1993).</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Considered for the role of Superman/Clark Kent in Superman (1978).</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Beatty and Jane Fonda did a screen test for the roles that eventually went to Troy Donahue and Connie Stevens in Parrish (1961).</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Was the original choice to play billionaire John Gates in Indecent Proposal (1993).</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>He showed interest in playing Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy (1969) but John Schlesinger thought Beatty was too famous to be believable as a naive street hustler.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Turned down the leads in Act One (1963), Youngblood Hawke (1964), The Graduate (1967), Getting Straight (1970), Cabaret (1972), Blume in Love (1973), All That Jazz (1979), Splash (1984), Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), Misery (1990) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Christopher Ciccone claimed in his memoir that he once saw a suspicious Beatty rifling through the wastebasket in Madonna’s home office at 3 a.m. looking for evidence she was cheating on him.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>His mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and his father, Ira Owens Beaty, a PhD. of educational psychology, public school administrator and real estate dealer, was from Virginia.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>His 40% of the box-office gross from Bonnie and Clyde (1967) netted him somewhere in the neighborhood of $28 million. The film played in theaters for six years. Based on the value of $28 million and its buying power in 1973, it would be the equivalent of having an estimated $150 million in 2016. This makes it one of the largest back-end deals for a movie star in Hollywood history.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Along with Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Woody Allen, Kenneth Branagh, Clint Eastwood and Roberto Benigni, he is one of only seven men to receive Academy Award nominations for both Best Actor and Best Director for the same film: Welles for Citizen Kane (1941), Olivier for Hamlet (1948), Allen for Annie Hall (1977), Beatty for both Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Reds (1981), Branagh for Henry V (1989), Eastwood for Unforgiven (1992) and Benigni for Life Is Beautiful (1997).</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Eldest daughter Kathlyn transitioned to male at the age of 14 and changed her name from Kathlyn Elizabeth to Stephen Ira Beatty.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>He was the visual inspiration for the original illustrations of the superhero Green Lantern/Charlie Vicker (created in 1967).</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>As of 2014 has appeared in four films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Heaven Can Wait (1978), Reds (1981) and Bugsy (1991).</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>He was a mentor to Diane Keaton.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Became a father for the first time at age 54 when girlfriend [now wife] Annette Bening gave birth to their daughter Kathlyn Beatty on January 8, 1992.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Became a father for the fourth time at age 63 when wife Annette Bening gave birth to their daughter Ella Beatty on April 8, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Became a father for the third time at age 59 when wife Annette Bening gave birth to their daughter Isabel Beatty on January 11, 1997.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Became a father for the second time at age 57 when wife Annette Bening gave birth to their son Benjamin Beatty on August 23, 1994.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Has never directed or acted with his sister Shirley MacLaine in any films.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>He has English, Scottish and distant Irish and Danish ancestry.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>In 1989, while working on Dick Tracy (1990), he came across a script titled “Ocean of Storms”. It was a love story about an aging astronaut who rejoins the lunar program for another shot at glory and falls for a female astronaut. It was written by documentary producer Ben Young Mason and veteran writer, producer, director and actor Tony Bill. Beatty bought the script through his Mulholland Productions and set it up at 20th Century-Fox. He planned on producing and starring in this as his next project after he completed his commitments on Bugsy (1991). However, like most Beatty projects, it was stalled in development. By 1993 he was working with Annette Bening on Love Affair (1994) and was planning on making “Ocean of Storms” their next project. He was trying to convince Martin Scorsese to direct it and hired Wesley Strick to do a rewrite for Scorsese. Scorsese eventually passed on the project but Beatty continued to develop it over the years, with rewrites from a slew of screenwriters including Robert Towne, Lawrence Wright, Stephen Harrigan and finally Aaron Sorkin. By 1999 Clint Eastwood and Warner Bros. had beaten Beatty to the punch by announcing their own aging astronaut movie, Space Cowboys (2000). After the success of that film, and the box-office flops of both Love Affair (1994) and Bulworth (1998), Beatty and 20th Century-Fox decided to cancel their plans to make “Ocean of Storms”.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>When he made his deal with Warner Bros. for Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the studio had such little faith in the future box-office results from the $2.5-million production that it agreed to give the film’s star and first-time producer 40% of the box-office gross. The deal worked out quite well for Beatty. Between 1967-73 when the film played in theaters, it generated over $70 million worldwide at the box office, netting Beatty an estimated $28 million.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>In September 2000 he was set to star in Steven Zaillian’s adaptation of the Geoffrey Wolff book “The Duke of Deception”. Zaillian had completed the script and was set to direct for producer Scott Rudin and Paramount. However, Beatty’s procrastination pushed the project back and eventually Zaillian moved on. At the time Beatty was also attached to star in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill”, but he eventually left that project as well.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Played two characters whose names differ by one letter: Joe Grady in The Only Game in Town (1970) and Joe Frady in The Parallax View (1974).</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>He and Clint Eastwood are the only actor-directors to earn Best Actor and Best Director Oscar nominations for the same film two separate times.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Despite their political differences, he is good friends with John McCain and Nancy Reagan. He was also a longtime friend of Ronald Reagan since his early career in Hollywood. As President, Reagan invited Beatty to screen his film Reds (1981) at the White House.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Only three times in Academy Award history have director-collaborators been nominated for Best Directing Oscars: Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for West Side Story (1961), Warren Beatty and Buck Henry for Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Joel Coen and Ethan Coen for No Country for Old Men (2007) (Wise/Robbins and the Coens actually won the award).</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>He is the godfather of longtime friend Richard Sylbert daughter, Daisy Alexandra Sylbert-Torres.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>His two favorite cartoon characters are Daffy Duck (who is his all-time favorite) and Johnny Bravo.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Has expressed interest in producing, directing and starring in a live-action Pokemon movie, with himself playing the villain Giovanni, as Pokemon is his youngest’s and second youngest’s favorite cartoon.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>Turned down a role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969).</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Claims he was offered the lead role in Rocky (1976).</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Was offered the role of Richard Nixon twice in his career: with Oliver Stone in Nixon (1995) and with Ron Howard in Frost/Nixon (2008).</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>Was offered the lead role in Jade (1995) but turned it down. David Caruso signed on to star instead.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>Long planned a biopic of Howard Hughes to produce and star in. It has yest to be made and it’s uncertain whether or not he has actually completed a script or if he also plans on directing it.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>What’s New Pussycat (1965), a name he often called girlfriends, was written for him, but he turned down the role when Leslie Caron–his girlfriend at the time–was turned down by producers for the female lead.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>A political liberal, he personally campaigned for South Dakota Senator George McGovern in the New Hampshire Democratic Presidential primary in 1972.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>Received the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award at The 72nd Annual Academy Awards (2000), presented to him by his friend and neighbor Jack Nicholson.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>Turned down the role of Jack Horner in Boogie Nights (1997). He later said that it was one of the few choices in his career that he regretted. Burt Reynolds garnered an Academy Award nomination for his performance in the film.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>His performance as Clyde Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) is ranked #32 on the American Film Institute’s 100 Heroes & Villains. This is ranking he shares with Faye Dunaway, who portrayed Bonnie Parker.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>Oliver Stone tried casting him twice–once as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street (1987) and then as Richard M. Nixon in Nixon (1995).</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>He is the only person to be nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Directing, Lead Actor & Screenplay) in the same year in two-times. First for Heaven Can Wait (1978), later for Reds (1981).</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>After coming to New York at 19 to pursue an acting career, he temporarily supported himself by working as a sandhog during the building of a new tube of the Lincoln Tunnel between New York and New Jersey.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Has produced two films that were nominated for Best Picture and had acting nominations in all four roles: Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Reds (1981)</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>Once worked as a cocktail lounge pianist.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>Became close to Robert F. Kennedy during his 1968 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Beatty’s relationship with him was closer than the one Beatty had with John F. Kennedy. Beatty was particularly valuable during the campaign in firing up volunteers for such mundane activities as door-to-door canvassing. RFK was impressed by Beatty’s thorough understanding of the issues. After Kennedy’s assassination in Beatty’s hometown of Los Angeles, he became a vocal gun control advocate.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>Beatty first espied future long-term lover Julie Christie at the 1966 Royal Command Performance of Born Free (1966) in London, which he attended with his then-girlfriend Leslie Caron. Caron and Beatty were situated near Christie in the reception line for Queen Elizabeth II, and Beatty first saw her in person when he turned to watch the Queen shake hands with her. Beatty inveigled his friend Richard Sylbert to tell her to call him. She did, he flew up to the San Francisco location of the Petulia (1968) shoot and, after a rocky start, they became lovers. She made her first public appearance with Beatty at a sneak preview of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) for the Hollywood elite. It took them several months to rid themselves of their then-current lovers before they came together in a committed relationship, although they usually maintained separate households for the length of their long romance. Most of those who knew them said they shared a passion for the truth. Beatty told his friends he had asked Christie to marry him, but she refused as she did not want children. While filming Shampoo (1975) in 1974, Beatty bought his dream house and brought Christie over to view it. When she realized he had already assigned several rooms as nurseries, it dawned on her that their ideas for the future were too far apart to be able to maintain their relationship. She ended her long affair with him by phone in the fall of 1974. His longest and most lasting relationship until he married Annette Bening, the mother of his four children, Beatty considered Christie his wife and told the press in 1971 that he would pay her alimony if they split up, if she wanted it. They did, but she didn’t. When he was awarded the Irving Thalberg Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in 2000, Christie was one of the friends and co-workers who appeared in a filmed tribute to him.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Rejected Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? (1969) because he wanted to work with George Stevens on The Only Game in Town (1970), which had a long and tedious production and turned out to be a disastrous flop. (Then-companion Julie Christie also turned down “Horses” and opted to make the sub-par In Search of Gregory (1969) because it was to be shot on location in Europe nearby where Beatty was making the Stevens film.) He turned down The Sting (1973) and The Great Gatsby (1974) so that he could devote his time to George McGovern’s presidential campaign.</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>His uncle by marriage, A.A. MacLeod, was the last sitting Communist member of the Canadian Parliament.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>Cohabited with Julie Christie from 1967 to ’74, albeit non-monogamously and with many on-again/off-again moments.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>Said that if they ever made a movie about his life story, Colin Farrell is the only person he thinks could play him.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>Along with Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson, Richard Attenborough and Kevin Costner, he is one of six people to win and Academy Award for “Best Director”, though they are mainly known as actors.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>John F. Kennedy wanted Beatty to play him in PT 109 (1963), after learning that director Elia Kazan had said that if anybody were to play JFK, it should be Beatty since they had so much in common. As Kazan stated, “Warren had everything Jack had. looks, intelligence, cunning and a commanding eye with the girls. Warren also suffered from lower back trouble”. Kennedy himself suggested Beatty to Warner Bros to play him. Jack L. Warner asked Beatty to fly over to Washington to meet JFK and talk about the movie with him, but Beatty did not want to make the trip, nor play the part. He found the script too weak and that there was a surprising lack of action. His assessment turned out to be right: Cliff Robertson played the part and the movie flopped. Months later, JFK and Beatty met and Kennedy had to concede that Beatty’s decision not to make the movie had been right. Beatty and Kennedy remained very good friends up until Kennedy’s death in 1963.</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>Was slated to play the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola’s dead project “Megaoplis”.</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>Premiere Magazine ranked him as #29 on a list of the Greatest Movie Stars of All Time in their Stars in Our Constellation feature (2005).</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>He directed seven different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Jack Warden, Dyan Cannon, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Maureen Stapleton, Al Pacino and himself (in Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Reds (1981). Maureen Stapleton won an Oscar for her performance in Reds (1981).</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>Was nominated for Broadway’s 1960 Tony Award as best supporting or featured actor (dramatic) for “A Loss of Roses”, later filmed as The Stripper (1963) with Richard Beymer in Beatty’s role.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>Credited with founding the concept of a political fund-raising concert when he and girlfriend Julie Christie backed the “Together with McGovern” concert in 1972 featuring Barbra Streisand, Carole King, James Taylor and even reuniting Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel (Simon & Garfunkel).</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>Was an advisor on George McGovern’s 1972 presidential campaign.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Based his Shampoo (1975) character “George Roundy” on celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring.</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004, along with Elton John, Joan Sutherland, John Williams, and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>In the films he produces, he usually plays characters who lose something important by the end of the film.</td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td>He has a photographic memory for phone numbers. He can dial a touch tone phone using the same hand technique as telephone operators.</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>Rumored to have been the subject of Carly Simon’s 1972 hit single “You’re So Vain”. After 43 years of speculation, Simon finally confirmed in November 2015 that the second verse of the song refers to Beatty. “Warren thinks the whole thing is about him!” she said.</td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td>Tested for the role of Tony in West Side Story (1961).</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>Turned down the role of Bill in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) because of the violent nature of the movie.</td></tr><tr><td>73</td><td>Uncle of actress Sachi Parker.</td></tr><tr><td>74</td><td>Is allergic to oysters.</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>Lives on famed “Bad Boy Drive” a.k.a.
