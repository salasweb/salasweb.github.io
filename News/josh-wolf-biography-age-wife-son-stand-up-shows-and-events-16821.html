You are a stand-up comic, actor, and writer. Which is your first passion?</strong></p><p><strong>Josh Wolf:</strong> Stand-up came first for sure. I was fifteen when I got up on stage for the first time. My mom and dad had to drive me to the show. That came first for sure. What is my love? That is a really tough question. There is nothing like a good stand-up set. A good set where you crush is like no other feeling. You just made a room full of people who don’t know each other, a random group of people all laugh at the same thing. It is not easy.</p><p><strong>AE: Did any comedian influence you growing up?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> Sam Kinneson. He was the first person I remember watching and was like what is he saying? He was the first person to talk about religion in a not so positive light. It was not negative since he was a preacher’s son. To hear him talk about starving people in Africa and joking about it. I never heard anyone talk like that before and get away with it. His delivery was so unique with his screaming. It was amazing to me. I couldn’t believe what I was listening to. It was like the first time I heard Nirvana. I was like what is that? It was the same thing.</p><p><strong>AE: I saw on your Facebook that your talk show “The Josh Wolf Show” will not be back on CMT, but you were still positive and from all the replies people posted they are hoping your show will get on another network or on Netflix. For fans of your show any news on that?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> I honestly don’t know. I can go pitch it around and see what happens. You mentioned being positive. I do believe this with all my heart. It is so much easier to be negative. The positive I think just serves everybody. It serves your life better.</p><p>I started raising my three kids by myself. It was me and my three kids living in one bedroom. One of my kids wanted his own room. He couldn’t have one. So he slept in the closet. From that I remember sitting in my negative. Almost every day I would say why me. One day I turned it around. I said I can’t be negative. I have to think about what is good. What was good was my kids. We had a new adventure every day.</p><p>The day that I stopped being negative was the day that my life turned around. You just have to change it in your own brain. For me how many people get to have their own television show that has their own name on it? Are you kidding me? Whether it was on for twelve seconds or twelve years it was amazing. It was a disappointment for sure, but I got to check something off my bucket list. That was something that I didn’t know if it was ever going to happen.</p><p><strong>AE: I loved when you and your guests would sing a random song. How did that make it as a segment into the show?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> Chelsey gave me the best advice I could get from anybody. She said make a show where no one else is watching it. I asked her what she meant by that. She said if you just do a show that only you are watching then you are going to do a show that you think is funny. You are going to do what you like to do. Then people will see the real you. The people who like it will watch. She said that it took her a little bit to learn that. She also said that remember the best part about you is you because nobody else can do that.</p><p>So I love the idea that everybody has a guilty pleasure song that they sing in their car with the windows rolled up. I was like what if I could get people to do that with me. I had Jewel come on and sing “I Want It That Way” with me. (Both laugh.) It was amazing. Are you kidding me? It was amazing. That is what we did. My son was on a bunch of times. My wife, my daughter, and my brother were on a few times. I made it for me. I had a great time doing it.</p><p><strong>AE: Speaking of your son how long did it take for Jake to talk to you after that bonding time segment on your show?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> (Both laugh.) Well you know what I always tell him? He will say something to me like do you have to do that? I will say do like those new shoes? He will say yes. I will then say well those jokes bought you those new shoes. So it is up to you. You can either have your new stuff or I can stop telling jokes.</p><p>That was fun though. He had a good time doing it. We did so much. We packed in so much in those six short weeks. We had so many experiences that most parents don’t get to have with their kids. It was really fantastic.</p><p><strong>AE: I see that you grew up in Massachusetts. I grew up in New Hampshire. People in New England are crazy for all the four main sport teams. Rank the teams in order of importance for you?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> I would go baseball first. So it would be Red Sox, Patriots, and Bruins and Celtics are tied for third.</p><p><strong>AE: I have to ask you about your book you published in 2013 called “It Takes Balls: Dating Single Moms and Other Confessions from an Unprepared Single Dad.” What was your inspiration for that?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> You go back to the time when I was sitting in that apartment. I didn’t exactly have money for therapy. So I would sit near my computer and I would vent. I would just write about whatever I was feeling or what happened that day. It could be about the crazy people that I ran into at the park or the weird things that would happen at the grocery store.</p><p>It was the only way for me to get what was inside of me out. A couple years later I went back and read it. I was like oh, there are some good stories. I threw some jokes in there. That was all it was. It was just me publishing my therapy sessions with myself. I added some other stories here and there. For me it is a mixture of real, heart, and funny. When you are living with three kids by yourself that is basically how you have to approach life. You have to look for the comedy wherever you can. If not then you will be a heavy drinker and I wasn’t ready for that.</p><p><strong>AE: Now switching to fatherhood how you balance work and family?</strong></p><p><strong>JW:</strong> You just do. I don’t know how else to put it. You just do. I always make sure that I catch the last plane out and the first one back. I try not to waste any of the time that I have. The truth of the matter is that if you look at the time that I am traveling. There are three days that I am gone. There are four days where I am here. No, I am not in an office. So the amount of time balances out. You just have to make a concerted effort to be present.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn7y0tIywpqWeXZe2sLPRmqehsV2WtKZ51qKdnmWjpLtuv9OapZ1lpaV6tLTOsKpmmZ6ZeqbCxKerrGc%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html&title=Josh%20Wolf%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Stand%20Up%2c%20Shows%20and%20Events" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html&description=Josh%20Wolf%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Stand%20Up%2c%20Shows%20and%20Events" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html&title=Josh%20Wolf%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Stand%20Up%2c%20Shows%20and%20Events" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html&title=Josh%20Wolf%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Stand%20Up%2c%20Shows%20and%20Events" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html&text=Josh%20Wolf%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Stand%20Up%2c%20Shows%20and%20Events" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fNews%2fjosh-wolf-biography-age-wife-son-stand-up-shows-and-events-16821.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Elina Uphoff</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2023-11-02</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=../News/justin-combs-biography-age-net-worth-siblings-dad-girlfriend-16809.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Justin Combs’ biography: age, net worth, siblings, dad, girlfriend</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=../Hot%20News/john-reardon-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-movies-and-net-worth-16785.html><h3>John Reardon Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Movies and Net Worth >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
