She is perhaps beat known for her roles in “Thelma and Louise”, and “Dead Men Walking”, the latter earning her an Academy Award (Oscar) fro Best Actress. The future cult classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” also drew audience attention to Susan’s abilities.</p><p>So just how rich is Susan Sarandon? According to sources, Susan Sarandon’s net worth is estimated to amount to $50 million. Undoubtedly, the main source of Susan Sarandon’s wealth is her acting career, which has spanned almost 50 years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=susan-sarandon-net-worth-50-million></span>Susan Sarandon Net Worth $50 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Susan Sarandon studied at the Catholic University of America, where she met her soon-to-be husband Chris Sarandon. Together with Chris, whom she married in 1967, Susan Sarandon auditioned for roles in the drama film “Joe”, and even though Chris did not get the part, Susan was offered a major role in the movie, and made her film-acting debut in 1970 with the release of the movie. After that, Sarandon made appearances in such soap operas as “Search for Tomorrow” and “A World Apart”, films like “The Front Page” and George Roy Hills’ “The Great Waldo Pepper”. However, Susan Sarandon spent almost ten years in the movie industry before she received her first nomination for the Academy Award in 1980, but the growth of her net worth had begun, and was to increase consistently throughout her future career..</p><p>The film that earned her such an honor was athe romantic crime-drama movie “Atlantic City”. Even though she did not receive the award, Sarandon continued to act in some of the more notable roles in several movies. Sarandon’s role in the horror film “The Hunger” caused a lot of controversy, which in turn exposed her to a bigger audience. Sarandon was at the peak of her career when she starred together with Jack Nicholson in “The Witches of Eastwick”, and in 1988 joined Kevin Costner in the romantic comedy film “Bull Durham”, which grossed over $50 million at the box office, and became one of Sarandon’s most commercially successful films, which contributed significantly to her net worth.</p><p>Since then Susan Sarandon has been constantly on the lists of Academy Awards nominations, and has won three of them for her roles in “The Client”, “Lorenzo’s Oil” and “Thelma & Louise”. At the time, Sarandon has been receiving many offers to appear in various movies, which in turn contributed a lot of her net worth. Throughout her lengthy acting career, Susan Sarandon has been featured in such movies as “The Banger Sisters” with Goldie Hawn, Kevin Lima’s musical comedy film “Enchanted”, “Shall We Dance?” with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and “Alfie” with Jude Law to name a few. There is no wonder that Susan’s net worth has grown steadily over the years.</p><p>Sarandon has also provided the voice to many documentary films, and more recently voiced a character in the action-adventure video game “Dishonored”.These contributed to her net worth, too.</p><p>Overall, Susan Sarandon has appeared in over 80 films and more than 40 TV films and series, plus narrating over 40 documentaries. There is certainly no doubting her abilities and popularity, and that her net worth is very well deserved</p><p>In her personal life, Susan Sarandon separated from her first husband Chris Sarandon in 1979, and from 1988 until 2009 lived with her partner Tim Robbins, who is a widely recognized American director, producer and screenwriter.

I need a structure that puts me in a microcosm of some kind.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I get paid a pretty good salary to do something that’s very childish. So how can I complain about anything?</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>[about Prozac] I don’t want to go on record as saying that nobody should be on it, but where are the artists going to come from? I think that every birthing is difficult and painful, and that sometimes you have every right to feel angry, and you have every right to feel miserable. And you have to get to the core of what that’s about. Medication alone is not going to do it. So I think sometimes you have to just go there. And out of that will come a really interesting person.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I see myself as having a little flashlight that lets you get information that you’re not getting, and then you make up your mind yourself how to act.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>[on negative reviews] Those kind of reviews don’t bother me because I’ve been through some really dry periods. If anything’s helped me through those times, it’s the fact that I started out as a character actor.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I am very romantic. For a women of my age and station, I have not been around very much at all. I’ve never developed that sportive kind of attitude toward sex. Thank God, as it turns out.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>[on her split from Tim Robbins] People were coming up to me in the street and saying “I cried and cried when I heard.” Well, I was sadder! I didn’t think it would ever happen, either.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>When things are going well, I like to have people to share it with. I’ve been alone in troubled times, and I don’t mind that. Some things have to be endured alone. As Hemingway said, the human being is strong in all the broken places.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>I couldn’t live in Hollywood; it’s too much of a company town. I never look at the trade papers. I used to, but I was scandalized by reading about actors who made deals before they read the script. How could they possibly do that?</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Men very often can see sex as a way of solving a problem, where women want the problem solved beforehand.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>[her rationale for turning down a role in Tightrope (1984)] The link between violence and sex was very strong. I met with Clint Eastwood and I said, “Aren’t you worried, especially you, who everybody thinks is like Man Personified, when your character starts to do some of this stuff, that it’s going to have a link between sex and violence and treating women badly?” And he said, “I don’t think that it’s my job to worry about that, I’m an actor.”</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>[in 1993 on Richard Gere] Richard has been in a lot of good films, but he’s never been in a great one.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>[on the death of James Gandolfini] So sad to lose James Gandolfini. One of the sweetest, funniest, most generous actors I’ve ever worked with. Sending prayers to his family.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>It’s better to have made decisions that turned out badly and learn from them than to feel as if you had no choice and are resentful of the turns that your life takes. My life has been filled with happy accidents. The thing that’s served me well is being able to change onto a different track when it’s presented itself. [Interview with George Stark, 2014]</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>I really respect filmmakers who manage to have lives, do the films the way they want to do them, have a sense of irony and humor about themselves and aren’t crippled by the terrible things this business does to you, and how it breaks your heart when films are not released properly.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>[on Brad Pitt and Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise (1991)] The day they did their scenes in bed was the only day they watched the dailies right through, which was suspicious to me. [It] was a very long lunch.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>I believe in love and trust and commitment, but not in marriage. Marriage may do something for lawyers and mothers, but not for husbands and wives. I deal with reality, with the feelings I have at the moment. And then I go on from there.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>I was definitely one of those Sixties girls with flowers in my hair and no bra and was influenced by certain drugs of that period, like cannabis or acid. But I always remind my kids that drugs are illegal. Some are a lot of fun, but some can kill you first time out. Mind-expanding drugs – like acid – are very different from the crack and heroin that’s around these days. My kids asked me if I used crack, which I thought was funny. I mean, they didn’t even have crack then, to show you how far back I go!</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>(1995, on being the eldest of nine children) I was the mother of everybody. And it took me a long time to understand that I didn’t have to mother every guy I was with. When I stopped doing that, things got better. When I became a mother, all of these things I had been practicing with grown men made sense, because this was the right time to do it.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>(1995, on having to do movie re-shoots) White Palace (1990). We shot the ending that was in the book, which is: she sits down, they look at each other, and you don’t know what’s gonna happen between them. But Pretty Woman (1990) had just come out, and they were thinking, “If we could only get him to marry her and they could have a big laugh.” Jimmy [James Spader] and I, we fought and fought, trying to keep our characters intact, but we did two re-shoots on that. On Sweet Hearts Dance (1988), that was a different problem, in that Don Johnson kind of threw the script out. So what happened was we had to do a month of re-shoots at two different times to put back things that had been taken out…The real mistake with that movie was that I thought it was about one thing, and they decided it was about these two guys who were never gonna grow up, a male-bonding thing. And who cares about that?</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>(1995, on relationships) I think the concept that there’s one person who’s gonna make you whole, this Gibran kind of thinking, is so detrimental. I don’t think it’s the other person’s responsibility to make you whole at all. It’s the other person’s responsibility to make you laugh, to give you a dance now and then, to read the newspaper and tell you about things you don’t have time to read about, to introduce you to music you don’t know, to tell you when you’re full of shit, to fight fair, to be good in bed, to say, “Come on, let’s go have an adventure” when you’ve become a little bit of a stick in the mud. But it’s not their job to make you whole. The test for me of a great romantic relationship is how productive you are during the relationship. You don’t need somebody who’s gonna keep you up till four in the morning and you don’t even know why you’re fighting. You don’t need somebody who you’re gonna go to a party and you’re worried about that they’re gonna get jealous, laid, drunk, stoned, or turn up missing. I like to go to a party and go my way and let somebody else go their way, and you meet up or you don’t meet up and then you go home together and nobody feels bad about it. That’s the perfect description of life, too- the party of life. I’ve been very lucky to find someone. We’ve been incredibly productive since we’ve been together.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>(1995, on the conception of her love scene in The Hunger (1983) and stereotypes men have about lesbianism) They felt that I should be really drunk so that was their way of taking away her choice in a sense, and I insisted that it not be that way, that certainly, you know, you wouldn’t have to get drunk to bed Catherine Deneuve. I don’t care what your sexual history to that point had been. It was much more interesting that she went voluntarily. […] I don’t think, for better or worse, that women are taken very seriously in this area. I think the feeling is when two women are together, then it’s probably experimental or some kind of phase and if the right guy came along, that would all change. So it’s actually something that straight men can watch and not be threatened by. And straight men are the ones that are propelling the industry forward, so I don’t think it’s taken that seriously.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>[About people criticizing Thelma & Louise (1991) for its violence and “anti-male” attitude] It shows what a straight, white male world movies traditionally occupy. This kind of scrutiny does not happen to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) or that Schwarzenegger thing [Total Recall (1990)] where he shoots a woman in the head and says, “Consider that a divorce”.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>On mothering: Children can reinvent your world for you.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>[on Thelma & Louise (1991)] The thing that separates this from a revenge movie with two males, for instance, is that there is a moral price to be paid by me for losing it, as you learn later, because I had been raped. I go into some kind of little trance there and just overreact. But I think the whole rest of the movie from that point on operates under the knowledge for this character that she is going to have to pay a price, and that there is no joy, really, in that revenge. it was important for me, as the movie went on, to try and figure out why these things keep happening, not to make it about getting even. So we tried in all the rest of the scenes to ask questions, or to make it clear, that she’s on some kind of search for an understanding of this moment. When I take off all my jewelry and my watch, I think I’m preparing to go into a zone where she feels she had to pay some kind of a price. That was very much in my mind from that moment on in the film.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Despite the statistics, nothing is hopeless, nothing is futile. We can do so much to protect children with awareness, knowledge, and a lot of love.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>I thought the whole point of feminism is that you’re not supposed to be defined by gender. I don’t understand the reasoning behind that, because I wouldn’t vote for Condoleezza Rice, and I hated Margaret Thatcher.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>People probably think of me as Debbie Downer. I have become kind of a joke in terms of activism for some people. But it is like worrying if your slip is showing when you’re fleeing a burning building. You have to prioritize.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>I think I’ve survived because I’ve gone through a number of incarnations. Sometimes they need somebody sexy. Sometimes they need somebody smart. I’ve managed to be able to morph myself into parts.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>You have to be careful not to be upstaged by your breasts. I’ve gotten curvier as I’ve gotten older. Directors cast the men they want to be and the women they want to have.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>The difference between theatre and film is kind of like the difference between making love and masturbation.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>I remember going to great lengths to celebrate disappointments like not getting a job. I’d take whatever little cash I had and go out to dinner. I saw loss as an opportunity to change direction.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>[on taking political stances] I think it’s a riot that people think that actors do this as a hobby or that somehow it’s gonna help your career. If you look at the number of people that are active, it’s miniscule. This whole myth about ‘Liberal Hollywood’ … the people with the power in Hollywood are the wealthy people and the bulk of them is not liberal. Hollywood is not political.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Every film is political in that it tells you some idea: What do women want? What does it mean to be a man? What is just? What is funny? What can you laugh at? What is not funny? So we notice the ones that challenge the status quo.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>I’ve maintained a fairly low standard of living in terms of cars, houses and planes and in that way I don’t have to make a huge amount of money to maintain my lifestyle.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>I think one of the reasons I haven’t married Tim is that I hate that couples assumption – that once you’re committed to someone you stop treating each other as individuals. I like getting up knowing I am choosing to be with that person.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>I never think about humiliating myself. I keep focusing on wanting to do a good job.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>I’m certainly not an expert, but Tim and I just celebrated 17 years together, which in Hollywood years I think is 45. I think the key is just focusing on this one person and not keeping one eye on the door to see who might be better.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>My children were embarrassed at my Lincoln Center Tribute. I forgot they would show film clips and my children hadn’t seen anything. Every time something a little racy would come on like The Hunger (1983), I’d look at my 13-year-old, who was shielding his eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>I haven’t yet had any plastic surgery, but I won’t knock it. I think women have the right to do anything they want to their bodies that makes them feel good about themselves. It’s hard to be in this business and be viewed on a screen that’s huge. You can see every single line. But I think it’s an aesthetic choice for the individual. I don’t like it when surgeons take a perfectly interesting looking woman and she ends up looking like a female impersonator with these gigantic breasts. It’s just so extreme and that worries me. I think everyone is looking the same.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>It’s always so painful to watch yourself. That never changes. I still sit there and think, “Oh, that scene is missing? Wasn’t I good? What happened there?”.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>The largest party in the United States is the 50 percent who don’t vote.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>The thing that’s bad about breasts is that you have to choose between having a mind and having breasts. It’d be nice if you could have both. Anyway, I think my breasts have been highly overrated.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>You’re so lucky in Ireland, England and Spain. Everyone there already knows what it’s like to have inexplicable terrorist violence.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>People will like you for the wrong reasons your entire life, even if you don’t have parents who are celebrities. They will like you because you have a car or you have money or your breasts are big.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>On Thelma & Louise (1991) after her nomination for best actress, 1992, “I was surprised that the film struck such a primal nerve. I knew when we were filming that it would be different, unusual and hopefully entertaining. But shocking? I guess giving women the option of violence was hard for a lot of people to accept”.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>If I were 22 and trying to build a career, I don’t know who’d be watching the kids as happily as I do. It takes so much to get me to break out of domestic paradise. There’s hardly anything that interests me as much as my family.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>I think the only reason I remain an actor is that you can never quite get it right. So there is a challenge to it.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Sexuality… is something that develops and becomes stronger and stronger the older you get… If you can continue to say yes to life and to maintain a certain generosity of spirit, you become more and more of who you are.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>I feel I’ve always been on the outside and always on the edge of an abyss. The women I portray, and the woman I am, are ordinary but maybe find themselves in extra-ordinary circumstances, and what they do is at great cost.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>I choose projects I can talk about for days because now you do publicity for as long as it took you to shoot the movie.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Endorsed Jill Stein as her “vote of conscience” in the 2016 presidential election of the United States.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Self-confessed cannabis user and admitted on Watch What Happens: Live (2009) in 2013 that she’s been stoned at almost all award shows except the Oscars.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Almost signed on to star in Serial Mom (1994) but the deal fell through due to scheduling conflicts and a salary dispute.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>After college Sarandon was affiliated with the Hanover Modeling School in New Haven, Connecticut and reigned as Miss Auto Show 1969 under the sponsorship of the Greater New Haven Car Dealers Association.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Was arrested in 1982 on charges of civil disobedience in New York City for protesting the tearing down of the Morosco Theater on Broadway.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Marched in a pro-choice demonstration on the National Wall in Washington D.C. while eight months pregnant in 1989.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Is the only actress who has been directed by both the Scott brothers (Ridley Scott and Tony Scott).</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Mother-in-law of Kyle Martino.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Said her most grueling audition process was for the female lead in the Marlon Brando/Jack Nicholson vehicle The Missouri Breaks (1976), because she was repeatedly called back in for readings over a period of six weeks but ultimately lost out to “a gal who didn’t do much after that” (Kathleen Lloyd).</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Caused a furor in 1984 when she defied Ronald Reagan’s opposition to the Sandinista government by taking an eight-day trip to Nicaragua, delivering milk and baby food to needy mothers under the auspices of a New York-based women’s group called MADRE.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Fans often confuse Susan with Sigourney Weaver and vice versa.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Her hair was naturally blonde in childhood.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Previously linked romantically with filmmaker Louis Malle, musician David Bowie and actor Sean Penn.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Was set to play Alexandra in The Witches of Eastwick (1987) until Cher was recast in the role at the last minute.
